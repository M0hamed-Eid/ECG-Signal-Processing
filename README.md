# ECG Signal Processing Project

This project implements signal processing techniques for analyzing ECG (electrocardiogram) signals. It includes MATLAB scripts for:

- Filtering the ECG signal to remove noise and interference.
- Detecting QRS complexes using the Pan-Tompkins algorithm.
- Estimating heart rate from the ECG signal.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open MATLAB and run the scripts (`main.m`, `pan_tompkins.m`) to process and analyze ECG signals.
